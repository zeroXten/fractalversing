          In this example we are going to be giving a philosophical dive through the lens of technology and design. Instead of two ontologies, we will make a single ontology that is at the cross-section of design and technology.  </p>

          <ul class="text-lg list-disc list-inside">
            <li>When we engage with a system, we become a part of it.</li>
            <li>Our interactions with an artifact design our mental models</li>

        <h2 class="text-pink-500 text-5xl mt-5">INTERPRETATION</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
For this example, we're going to use an idea as a point of exploration. This idea is: "How does the expression of multistability, affect how oppresive or liberatory a technology is and what does it say about the nature of technology?        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          We'll create an interpretation for each of the verses we created above.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
When we engage with a system, we become a part of it.        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">Artifacts with more multistable features give users more agency to shape their experience, potentially leading to a more liberatory technology. On the other hand, artifacts with fewer multistable features may limit user agency and lead to a more oppressive technology.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
Our intereactions with an artifact design our mental models.        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
Complexity in system creates complexity in mind through the engagement with its parts.        </p>
        
        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
When we create an artifact, it is an act of power        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">The design of an artifact is not a neutral process. It carries with it power dynamics throught the lens of the designer and corporation. Liberation or oppression is a corporate choice.        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
When we design for many potential states, we open ourselves up to the possibility for new knowledge to be expressed.        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
Technological artifacts can be a form of exploration and experimentation with the potential to yield new insights and understandings.        </p>

        <h2 class="text-pink-500 text-5xl mt-5">CONCLUSION</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          Thinking through the verses and their implications on the specific topic at hand, it is clear that in this exploration that technology plays a significant shaping role in human dynamics. As I get closer to the formulation of theories of technology, I see the emergence of very particular themes: power, features, identity within a artifact/system, and flourishing.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
There is still much for me to explore in order ot proceed with writing a cohesive theory. But through FractalVersing I have considered many perspectives and themes that I might have gone ignored.        </p>
