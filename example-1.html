        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          In this example we are going to look at a small business from an economic and ecological perspective. So we'll create two different FractalVersing ontologies, one from each perspective.

          Full disclosure, I am neither a business founder, economist, nor ecologist, so you'll have to use your imagination and allow me some artistic licence.

        <h2 class="text-pink-500 text-5xl mt-5">INTERPRETATION</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          For this example we're going to use a small business that's creating a brand new soft drink.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          We'll create an interpretation for each of the verses we created above.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          When motivated, we seek value. From value comes motivation.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          Thirst is a powerful feeling. Hydration is essential for health. When we reach out for a drink, are we thirsty, dehydrated, or simply craving?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          Through aspirations are we primed to buy.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          What does the consumer aspire to? Healthier, fitter lifestyle? Better at sport? An active and exciting social life? A moment of peace and quiet?
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          When the conversation turns to price, we become the seller.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          The price has to match the aspiration. Low price means accessible, high price means luxury or scientific. But we must keep an eye on margins or risk quality.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          Saving money creates the capacity to spend money
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          Consumers are unlikely to buy soft drinks in order to cut costs. They are either purchased out of necessity (out and about), or as a treat.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          When we put a price on something, it becomes-product
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          Are we selling a product, or a lifestyle? A philosophy, or a solution? A soft drink is fundamentally a product, but the price and brand we set will make that more or less obvious.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          The transformation from nature to raw material at human-scale is finite, at geological-scale it is futile
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          We have to take responsibility for the impact we create on ourselves and our environment. Packaging, especially plastic bottles, are a huge ecological problem, and microplastics are now everywhere. Ultimately we will have to balance profit against sustainability.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          Consuming energy creates waste. All waste is wasted energy.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          It costs energy and resources to obtain raw material, to create soft drinks, to distribute them to consumers, to manage the waste they create. Every step consumes energy and creates waste. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          As we grow, so do our needs. Exponential growth creates super-exponential waste.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          Soft drinks are big business. Does the world really need yet another soft drink? Could we do something different, that brings balance? Could we somehow reduce the amount of soft drinks consumed in the world?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-left italic font-bold">
          We work to consume, and consume to work. What responsibilities do we hold on either side of the equation?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          Our target consumers are workers, members of society, each playing a role. Our own staff are included in this too. Is how we run as a business, how we treat our staff, consistent with the ethos of the brand?
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-pink-500 text-5xl mt-5">CONCLUSION</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          As the founder of this fictitious soft drink brand, we looked at the verses, reflected on them, and thought about the implications on our idea. Perhaps profit is what we're going for, and we ignore the environmental impact. That's someone else's problem. We're just giving people a choice, ultimately it is their responsibility. But maybe there's a different way. The Anti Soft Drink. A recipe book that allows people to create their own soft drinks at home. Sustainable bottles made from natural materials. A subscription of ingredients that allows people to easily make delicious natural drinks at home. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-stone-900 mt-5 text-justify">
          Ultimately it is for the founder to decide how to proceed. But through FractalVersing they have at least considered a different perspective, a broader perspective, a perspective that could lead to better decisions.
